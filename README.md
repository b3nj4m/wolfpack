# wolfpack

This colorscheme is heavily inspired by [Bliss](http://colorsublime.com/theme/Bliss) by  Saad Quadri. I added my own flair to the theme to make it, in my opinion, better. I use a modified version of [n0tch2k](https://github.com/baskerville/iTerm-2-Color-Themes/blob/master/n0tch2k.itermcolors) for terminal colors. I only changed this minorly, but it fits the scheme. I have included both an itermcolors and Xresources of said modded version of n0tch2k. 

## Installation
You can use your favorite plugin manager. I use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).

    Plugin 'carlson-erik/wolfpack'

Don't forget to change the color of your terminal using the Xresources or iTerm colors files.

## Usage
Don't forget to add this to your `.vimrc`.

    colorscheme wolfpack
    
## Note
This theme is still very much in progress. I mainly use this theme for programming in C++ and Python. I have provided *some* color tests below. It is mainly tested in terminal on my Arch install and in iTerm2 on my Macbook Pro. I also have tested it in MacVim. The theme holds true in all forms. If you have suggestions, email me.

## TODO
Light background version
